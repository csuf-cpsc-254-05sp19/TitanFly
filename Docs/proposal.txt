An overview of the Project:
We are creating a python game called Titan Fly, which represents the lifestyle of a
college student getting through a course. The student will be required to go through the vertical
pipes, which signifies the different assignments and tasks required to get through the class. As
points, you get through each pipe you gain points, which will add up to the required points
needed to pass the class. If you fail to reach the point requirements you have to restart the game
and try again.

Goals of our software:
Our goals are to have a running version of the game by the end of the semester. And if
possible to add sound effects to the game. We also look forward to create an application that is
compatible with most versions of desktop computers.

How we use the Open Source Library:
Pygame will allow us to run our python code as a desktop application and act as a
graphics engine for the logic.
Resources used to build your software i.e. any open source libraries used, tools used or any
existing open source project :

We will be using pythonâ€™s open source library pygame, and an open source project of Flappy
Bird available on GitHub. Although we are not directly modifying the repository. Rather we are
creating our own custom game. Below are the links of the libraries:
