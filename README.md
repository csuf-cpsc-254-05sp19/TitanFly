# Project Details:
    We are creating a python game called Titan Fly, which represents the lifestyle of a college student getting through a course. The student will be required to go through the vertical pipes, which signifies the different assignments and tasks required to get through the class. As points, you get through each pipe you gain points, which will add up to the required points needed to pass the class. If you fail to reach the point requirements you have to restart the game and try again. 
    
    We will be using pythonâ€™s open source library pygame, and an open source project of Flappy Bird available on GitHub. Although we are not directly modifying the repository. Rather we are creating our own custom game. Below are the links of the libraries:
